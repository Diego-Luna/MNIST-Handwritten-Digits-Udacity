## MNIST Handwritten Digits

This project is focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning models.

## Introduction

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

## Methods

Various models such as logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks were used to classify the digits. The data was preprocessed and normalized to improve the accuracy of the models.

## Results

The models achieved high accuracy, with neural networks performing the best with an accuracy of over 98%.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in classifying handwritten digits and the importance of data preprocessing.

## Code

The code for this project can be found in the file `MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.ipynb`.
